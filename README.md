## Objectives
1. **Price Trend Analysis:**
    - Examine the price trend over a specified period.
    - Compute the Simple Moving Average (SMA) to assess its implications for stocks and investors.

2. **Dividend Impact:**
    - Analyze the effect of dividend announcements on stock performance.

3. **Risk Analysis:**
    - Evaluate the stock's historical volatility to determine its risk profile.
    - Analyze the trade-off between the stock's volatility and return.
    - Calculate the Sharpe ratio to facilitate informed decision-making.

4. **Comparative Analysis:**
    - Assess the performance of various stocks using their ticker symbols.
    - Compare stock performance against major indices or benchmarks.

## Findings
- At the start of this century, all stock prices were relatively low, reflecting poor stock performance (Figure 1).
- From approximately 2003 to 2004, all four stocks demonstrated consistent and strong performance, which continued until 2020 to 2021. This period of growth was notably interrupted by the global COVID-19 pandemic, which had widespread economic and market impacts worldwide (Figure 1).
- Among the four stocks, Walt Disney (DIS) experienced the most significant price loss during this period (Figure 1).
- For Walt Disney (DIS), the trend occasionally dips below zero, indicating a potential risk factor (Figure 2).
- JNJ and T demonstrate a long-term upward trend for yearly price trends with occasional short-term downward fluctuations (Figure 2).
- Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and AT&T Inc. (T) trends rarely fall below zero, which makes them more favorable investment candidates compared to Walt Disney (DIS) (Figures 3 and 4).
- In the cases of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and AT&T Inc. (T), the stock prices experienced a significant decline following the announcement of dividends (Figures 3 and 4).
- Walt Disney (DIS) and JPMorgan (JPM) exhibit limited price changes, indicating that the overall performance and outlook of these companies are robust enough to counterbalance the expected price drop due to the dividend payout (Figures 3 and 4).
- Although JPMorgan (JPM) has demonstrated the highest returns over the years, it is accompanied by a significant risk factor (Figures 5 and 6).
- Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) exhibits the lowest annual return, coupled with a stable return trend, indicating a low risk factor (Figures 5 and 6).
- JPMorgan (JPM) exhibits the highest Sharpe Ratio among the analyzed stocks, indicating that it delivers higher returns relative to its risk level. However, this also suggests that the returns come at the cost of assuming greater risk (Figure 7).
- AT&T Inc. (T) demonstrates the lowest Sharpe Ratio among the analyzed stocks, indicating that it provides relatively lower returns for the level of risk undertaken (Figure 7).
- The Sharpe Ratio of Walt Disney (DIS) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) is balanced (Figure 7).
- The annual volatility versus annual return graph also confirms that JPMorgan (JPM) offers high returns accompanied by high risk (Figure 8).
- Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) has low returns with low risk (Figure 8).
